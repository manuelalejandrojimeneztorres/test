- **Secure Authentication:** Powered by JWT and bcrypt.
- **Survey Management:** APIs for creating, updating, and deleting surveys.
- **Data Insights:** Efficient data retrieval for analytics.
- **Scalable Architecture:** Designed for horizontal and vertical scalability.
- **API Documentation:** Comprehensive OpenAPI 3.0.3 documentation for developers.

---

## Prerequisites

Ensure the following tools are installed on your system:

- [Node.js (>=16.x)](https://nodejs.org/)
- [MySQL Server (>=8.x)](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- **Optional:**
  - [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) or any REST API client for testing APIs.
